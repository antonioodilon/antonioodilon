Hello! My name is Antonio de Odilon, and I have recently started to learn Python by taking Tim Buchalka and Jean-Paul Roberts' "Learn Python Programming Masterclass" at Udemy: 
https://www.udemy.com/course/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/ . Despite coming from the humanities area, since starting the course I have become a Python 
enthusiast, and have been more than willing to learn more about the language and programming in general. After completing the course I also intend to start studying the Flask and Django web frameworks for Python. Finally, I can't wait to eventually get a job as a programmer!
