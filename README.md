Hello! My name is Antonio de Odilon, and I have recently started to learn Python by taking Tim Buchalka and Jean-Paul Roberts' "Learn Python Programming Masterclass" at Udemy: 
https://www.udemy.com/course/python-the-complete-python-developer-course/ . Despite coming from a humanities-related area, since starting the course. I have become a Python 
enthusiast, have been willing to learn more about the language and programming in general. I also have an interest in studying Math and am currently studying Franklin D. Demana, 
Bert K. Waits, Gregory D. Foley, Daniel Kennedy's book "Pre-Calculus: Graphical, Numerical, Algebraic". Finally, I am more than eager to eventually get a job as a programmer.
